# typescript-backend

This is my solution to Vivacity Tech Software Engineer Intern Application Exercise
Backend Requirements:
1. Create a web server in TypeScript using Node and Express
2. Create an API endpoint at this route: “/awesome/applicant” that returns some fun information about yourself. 
3. Enable CORS so that the frontend application can retrieve this information
4. Store this code in GitHub and add nathanbirch as a collaborator
